                                                    <p>It was Sunday morning, three days after the crucifixion.  Mary went to the tomb where Jesus’ body had been interred.  Most likely she wanted to complete the ritual of anointing his body.  Mary found that the stone sealing the tomb had been rolled away, and the grave was empty.  She wept.</p>

                                                    <p>Mary had risen early, prepared what was necessary for the anointing.  We can imagine that she hadn’t slept very well.  Thoughts of the future were probably uppermost in the minds of all Jesus’ disciples and followers.  What would happen now that their Master was dead?  Death had always been final.</p>

                                                    <p>Mary had been with Jesus since he cast out of her seven devils.  It’s probable that before meeting Jesus that her life was a complete mess.  Every area of her life was apparently affected.  But after Jesus healed her she had dignity, sanity, purpose, salvation, a clear mind, a healthy body, joy and a faithful friend, mentor and guide.</p>

                                                    <p>Now that Jesus was gone, Mary most likely felt that holding onto her new life would be difficult, perhaps impossible. If I was Mary at the tomb that Sunday morning, I would have been weeping too.</p>

                                                    <p>An angel saw her weeping and asked, “Woman, why are you weeping.”  At one level, the angel wanted to help her with her current problem – the missing body.  At another level, the angel knew that death had not held Christ captive.  The angel also knew that on the cross Christ had taken the full force of the wrath of God for all humanities’ sin.  The angel knew that it was very much possible for Mary to retain all of her new life. The angel knew that there was no need to weep.</p>

                                                    <p>The Jesus came near and also asked, “Woman, why are you weeping?”  When Mary recognised Jesus, she clung to him, and he asked her not too depend too much on his physical presence for he would ascend to the Father.  Jesus also knew that it was possible for Mary to hold onto her newfound dignity and purpose, for He had conquered death and sin.  He also knew that the Holy Spirit was coming soon to comfort, protect and guide His people.  There was no need to weep.</p>

                                                    <p>As humans we have seasons of grief.  We weep when we lose loved ones.  We weep when things we have depended on fail us.  But mostly we weep when we have held on too tightly to things that will inevitably pass away.  The one thing that will never fail us is Christ.  We can hold onto what we have in Him and it cannot and will not be taken away from us.</p>
